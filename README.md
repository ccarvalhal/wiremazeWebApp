# wiremazeWebApp
Wiremaze Message Board Web App

1. This project is my solution for a challenge for a recluitment process for Wiremaze.

2. You will need NodeJS and a MongoDB DBMS to test this application. Configure properly the file "connection.js".

3. You have a script ("initializeDB.js") to initialize the database:

node bin/initializeDB.js

or

npm run initializeCollections

4. Everybody can submit comments but comments are published only after the validation by the administrator.

5. To switch between the regular and administrative views, click the main title of the page.
